  <h1>Extra Information on Security Principles & Concepts</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Weakest Link Principle</h2>
    <p>
      In practice, the weakest link in a security system is often the human element. 
      Attackers frequently exploit poor password choices, social engineering, or 
      phishing instead of attacking strong encryption or secure servers.  
      A good example is two-factor authentication: even if a password is leaked, 
      the second factor (like a code on a phone) strengthens the chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Systems should be audited regularly, because over time, what used to be a strong 
      link (e.g., an encryption algorithm) might become the weakest one once new 
      cryptanalysis methods are discovered.
    </p>

    <h2>Timeliness</h2>
    <p>
      Timeliness also applies to incident response. A security breach that is discovered 
      quickly can be contained before it spreads. Organisations often measure 
      <i>Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)</i> and <i>Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)</i> as 
      indicators of security effectiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many organisations use automated monitoring systems (SIEM tools) that can 
      alert staff in seconds rather than days or weeks.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Effectiveness</h2>
    <p>
      Effectiveness means striking a balance. For example, using military-grade 
      encryption for a home Wi-Fi router may not be necessary, but ensuring that 
      weak or obsolete protocols (like WEP) are not used is critical.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Overly strict security can also reduce effectiveness: if employees are forced 
      to change passwords every week, they may start writing them down, which makes 
      the system weaker overall.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Defense in Depth</h2>
    <p>
      Defense in Depth means layering multiple independent security controls.  
      For example:
      <ul>
        <li>Firewalls protect the network perimeter.</li>
        <li>Intrusion detection systems monitor for suspicious activity.</li>
        <li>Encryption protects data if the perimeter is breached.</li>
        <li>Access controls ensure that even insiders have limited privileges.</li>
      </ul>
      If one layer fails, others remain in place, reducing the overall risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      This principle is widely used in military strategy and adapted to cybersecurity 
      because no single defense is perfect.
    </p>

    <h2>Real-World Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      - Security is not just technical — it also involves legal, financial, and ethical dimensions.  
      - Many industries must comply with standards such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, or HIPAA.  
      - Attackers are adaptive: once a defensive measure becomes widespread, they shift 
        to targeting less protected areas.  
      - Security awareness training for employees is one of the most cost-effective 
        investments organisations can make.

  <h2>Public Key Encryption (PKE) vs Symmetric Key Encryption (SKE)</h2>
<p>Encryption systems are broadly divided into two categories: symmetric key and public key.</p>

<h3>Symmetric Key Encryption (SKE)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Definition:</b> Both the sender and receiver share the same secret key for encryption and decryption.</li>
  <li><b>Speed:</b> Very fast, making it suitable for encrypting large volumes of data.</li>
  <li><b>Security Concern:</b> Key distribution is a major issue—how do two parties securely exchange the secret key?</li>
  <li><b>Examples:</b> AES, DES, 3DES, ChaCha20.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Public Key Encryption (PKE)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Definition:</b> Uses a pair of mathematically related keys: a public key (for encryption) and a private key (for decryption).</li>
  <li><b>Speed:</b> Slower compared to symmetric encryption due to the complexity of mathematical operations.</li>
  <li><b>Security Advantage:</b> Eliminates the need to share a secret key; the public key can be openly distributed.</li>
  <li><b>Examples:</b> RSA, ElGamal, ECC.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Comparison</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Performance:</b> SKE is faster, PKE is slower.</li>
  <li><b>Key Management:</b> SKE requires secure exchange of secret keys, while PKE simplifies distribution but requires strong private key protection.</li>
  <li><b>Use Cases:</b> PKE is often used to exchange symmetric keys securely, and then SKE is used for the actual data transfer.</li>
</ul>
